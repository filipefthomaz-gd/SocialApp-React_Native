# Social App using React Native and Firebase

A SocialApp prototype using React-Native and Firebase for authentication. Credit to [Pradit Debnath] (https://github.com/itzpradip/react-native-firebase-social-app) for the tutorial.

Currently mostly Front-End is implemented, alongside a Firebase account (Android only for now) that allows for mail/password and GMail authentication.
